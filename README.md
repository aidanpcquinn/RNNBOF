### Demo notebook and accompanying modules for the submitted research paper: Globally Trained Recurrent Neural Network for Forecasting the Presence of Inpatient Aggression


## Authorship: 

#### Aidan Quinn, to be submited as part of their final thesis for Masters of Data Science at Monash Unviersity under supervision of Christoph Bergmeir.


## Environment details:

#### Docker info
- All experiments were performed in the official nvidia tensorflow docker container: 21.03-tf2-py3
- nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorflow:21.03-tf2-py3

#### Specific versions of all imported libraries can be seen in requirements.txt



## Usage:
#### Descriptions and usage examples for all functions present in ExperimentDemo.ipynb, this file acts purely as instructions and usage examples.

NB: The Hospital risk assessment dataset that was used in the accompanying paper is not openly available due to sensitive and potentially identifying information. This notebook serves as a demo, with instructions included for all code made use of during the experiments as well as example outputs as they appeared when running the described experiments.
